this is some awesome test here, I am really quite amazed. 
In particular, we are going to get some reasonable compression 
even though our encoding vocab size is only one more than the input vocab size!
Of course, this is not impossible because our encoding is context-dependent!
Even more amazingly would be if we could compress *twice* and get some reasonable compression!
That would indeed be the holy grial. I'm not sure if it will happen with this text, but we will try!

The art of data compression has fascinated computer scientists for decades. 
From the early days of Huffman coding to modern algorithms like LZ77 and LZ78, 
the quest for efficient compression has driven innovation in computer science.
What makes this particularly interesting is how we can achieve compression even with 
minimal vocabulary expansion. The hierarchical approach we're testing here takes 
advantage of context-dependent encoding, allowing us to represent longer sequences 
with fewer tokens. This is especially powerful when dealing with natural language, 
where patterns and repetitions emerge at multiple levels of abstraction.

Consider how human language itself is a form of compression - we use words to 
represent complex concepts, and these words can be combined in countless ways 
to express even more complex ideas. Our hierarchical encoder attempts to mimic 
this process, learning patterns at different levels of context. The beauty of 
this approach is that it can adapt to the specific characteristics of the input 
data, whether it's natural language, code, or any other form of structured information.

The real test of our compression algorithm lies in its ability to handle 
longer texts while maintaining efficiency. By using a vocabulary size that's 
only slightly larger than the input vocabulary, we're pushing the boundaries 
of what's possible with context-dependent encoding. This is particularly 
challenging because we need to balance the trade-off between compression ratio 
and the ability to represent all possible input sequences.

Let's explore the fascinating world of data compression further. When we look at 
natural language, we notice that certain patterns appear frequently. For example, 
common word pairs like "data compression" or "encoding algorithm" appear multiple 
times in this text. Our hierarchical encoder should be able to recognize these 
patterns and represent them more efficiently. The beauty of this approach is that 
it can learn these patterns automatically, without needing explicit rules or 
predefined dictionaries.

The hierarchical nature of our compression algorithm is particularly interesting 
because it mirrors how human language works. We don't just use individual words; 
we combine them into phrases, sentences, and paragraphs. Each level of combination 
creates new patterns that can be compressed further. This is why context-dependent 
encoding is so powerful - it can capture these hierarchical relationships and 
use them to achieve better compression ratios.

In the realm of data compression, we often talk about the trade-off between 
compression ratio and speed. Some algorithms focus on achieving the highest 
possible compression, while others prioritize speed. Our hierarchical approach 
attempts to find a sweet spot between these two goals. By using a minimal 
vocabulary expansion, we keep the encoding process relatively simple while 
still achieving good compression through context-dependent patterns.

The concept of context-dependent encoding is not new, but our implementation 
takes it to an interesting extreme. By limiting the vocabulary size to just 
one more than the input vocabulary, we're forcing the algorithm to be very 
efficient in how it uses its limited resources. This constraint actually helps 
us discover more creative ways to represent patterns in the data.

When we look at the history of compression algorithms, we see a clear evolution 
from simple statistical methods to more sophisticated context-aware approaches. 
The LZ family of algorithms, which our implementation is based on, represents 
a significant step forward in this evolution. By considering the context of 
each symbol, these algorithms can achieve much better compression ratios than 
their predecessors.

The hierarchical approach we're testing here takes this concept even further. 
Instead of just considering the immediate context, we're building multiple 
levels of context awareness. This allows us to capture patterns that span 
different levels of abstraction, from individual characters to entire phrases. 
The result is a compression algorithm that can adapt to the specific 
characteristics of the input data, whether it's natural language, code, 
or any other form of structured information.
